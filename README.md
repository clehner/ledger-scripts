Data import scripts
-------------------

Convert transactions from various CSV formats into Ledger format.

#### `lbcsv2ledger`
Import LocalBitcoins transactions into ledger.

Parses the "Completed Contacts" CSV file. Automatically calculates the missing
fee.

#### `fidelity2ledger`
Import Fidelity transactions

Handles commodities/funds properly.

#### `mint2ledger`
Import Mint transactions.

Combines transfers between accounts, and allows for arbitrary renaming of
transactions.

#### `dwolla2ledger`
Import transactions from a Dwolla statement.

#### `mtgox2ledger`
Import MtGox trading history.

Reads both the USD and BTC CSV files exported from Mt.Gox.

Does not combine corresponding withdraw fees and withdraw debits.

#### `btce2ledger`
Import BTC-E trading history. *Incomplete, but may be useful for a start.*

Reads data that you copy and paste from BTC-E's Transactions history table.

#### `electrum2ledger`
Import transaction history from an Electrum wallet.

Reads a CSV file exported from Electrum.

#### `blockchain2ledger`
Import transactions from a blockchain.info export.

#### `havelock2ledger`
Import transactions from a Havelock Investments account.

#### `campbx2ledger`
Import transaction history for a CampBX account.

#### `cryptotrade2ledger`
Import transaction history for a Crypto-Trade account.

To obtain the TSV data to import, visit the
[transactions page](https://crypto-trade.com/member/transactions), and for each
page of results, copy and paste the table into a text file such that each row
from the table is in its own line, with the values in the cells seperatd by tabs.

#### Coinbase

Two scripts are provided for processing two types of CSV files that Coinbase
exports. For best results, run both, merge the results, and then reconcile it
with the online transaction history.

* `coinbase2ledger-transactions`

Import transactions (`Coinbase-Transactions-Export...csv`). This contains every
buy, sell, send and receive in the account, but the fee amounts for the buy and
sell transactions are not always provided, and the BTC amount for buy and sell
transactions is not always accurate. The bitcoin transaction IDs are usually
included.

* `coinbase2ledger-transfers`

Import transfers/trades (`Coinbase-Transfers-Export...csv`)

This one has full fee details and exact BTC amounts for each buy/sell transfer,
but does not include other transactions sent and received from the account.

More scripts

#### `getquote`

Get quotes for various stocks, currencies, and commodities.

Covers:

BTC, altcoins, gold, silver, Havelock Investments, CryptoTrade, CryptoStocks,
and NASDAQ.

#### gethistoric

#### `claws-filter`

them to a ledger journal.

* Payments sent from Paypal, Dwolla, and Coinbase.

#### `merge-ledger`

Merge multiple ledger journals into one, in roughly time order. It prompts you to
merge transactions between journals that might be the same.
